One of the key aspects of developing a website using a static-site generator is understanding that the content is not served dynamically at the time of a request. In order to publish new content, the static website must be regenerated. An initial reaction could be that this is an arduous process that would require a developer or DevOps. However, this does not have to be the case.

This very website was developed using Gatsby and Kontent.ai and is hosted by Netlify. In order to streamline content publishing, I configured Kontent.ai to trigger a build which is automatically pushed live by Netlify - and this is how it was done.

Firstly, you need to log into your Netlify account and create a new [Build Hook](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/#incoming-webhooks).

Once you have created a build hook you will see a URL.

Your Netlify build hook is now created, time to configure Kontent.ai to send a request to the URL and trigger the Netlify build. Log in to your Kontent.ai account and navigate to Project Settings > Development > Webhooks.

In this new window click the Create new Webhook button and enter a name and the URL from your Netlify build hook.

Finally, click save and you're ready to go.

Try publishing some new content on Kontent.ai and check your Deploys queue in Netlify.
